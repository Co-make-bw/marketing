Our app, Co-make, is designed to bring attention to local issues affecting a community. To do so, users will register and post issues, and the most upvoted issues will be prioritized. Our mission is to leverage the synergy of the community.

Features currently included include sign up, login, and issues as filtered by primary location.

Features to be included in future releases will include 
-Geocoding API
-The ability to add images to the issue page with an API
-Links to Social Media

The marketing homepage is located at https://co-make-bw.github.io/marketing/. 

The source code for the marketing page is found here in this repo. The only dependency to compile the CSS is Less Compiler.
