          <h2>About Natalie</h2>
          <p> Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or neighborhood
            goes ages without being resolved?</p><br>

          <p> You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas..),
            overgrown plant issues, or anything else that makes living where you
            live a little less pleasant.</p><br>

          <p>With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues you would
            like to see resolved in your community.
          </p><br>

          <p>Problems with the most upvote get prioritized by local government
            or HOA’s to be resolved first. As well as seeing real change in your
            community you get rewards for being a positive community member in
            the form of points, freebies and
            local recognition.</p><br>

          <p>The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the relationship
            between local government and the people they represent. The feeling
            of apathy many have towards local issues. The inability of local
            government to reach and listen to their
            constituents effectively.</p><br>
