          <h2>Section 1</h2>
          <p> Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or neighborhood
            goes ages without being resolved?</p><br>

          <p> You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas..),
            overgrown plant issues, or anything else that makes living where you
            live a little less pleasant.</p><br>

          <p>With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues you would
            like to see resolved in your community.
          </p><br>

          <h2>Section 2</h2>
          <p>Problems with the most upvote get prioritized by local government
            or HOAâ€™s to be resolved first. As well as seeing real change in your
            community you get rewards for being a positive community member in
            the form of points, freebies and
            local recognition.</p><br>

          <p>Just use the old one inch brush. Don't fight it, use what happens.
            Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. I started painting
            as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I
            believe talent is just a pursued interest.
            Anybody can do what I do. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.</p><br>

          <h2>Section 3</h2>

          <p>The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the relationship
            between local government and the people they represent. The feeling
            of apathy many have towards local issues. The inability of local
            government to reach and listen to their
            constituents effectively.</p><br>
          <p>Let the paint work. Let's put some highlights on these little
            trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Everybody needs a friend. Now
            we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.
            Any little thing can be your friend if
            you let it be.</p><br>
